          We will review your designs (website or mobile/web app) and explore
          where the design works well and where it can be improved. We focus our
          process around one central question: “What can we do to make this
          design more efficient?”

            <p class="p_main gray">
              Unlike any other design review or audit, we will not only tell you
              what can be improved but also make revamps to the most critical
              parts of the design.

            <h2 class="h2_main">Design Report</h2>
            <p class="p_main gray">
              We will evaluate your design based on a variety of parameters and
              provide a detailed visual report with useful tips and design hacks.
              This would be the starting point for further work on the design.

            <h2 class="h2_main">Ways to Redesign</h2>
            <p class="p_main gray">
              We provide several strategies for further redesign by various
              contractors, from freelancers to high-end agencies. We provide you
              with an assessment of the timing and cost for both a full redesign
              and quick but effective improvements.
